# Introduction

What exactly is the DoPortal app, and what motivated its creation? The inspiration behind the inception of this application stemmed from a compelling necessity within a non-profit organization dedicated to facilitating students' access to higher education: the imperative transition to a paperless operation. Picture an archive reminiscent of a cluttered closet, filled with decades-old files and documentation. Witnessing my colleagues and superiors expending an exorbitant amount of effort on paper-based tasks year-round left me with a profound unease. What if there existed a more efficient, digital alternative, liberating them from the burdensome chore of lugging physical documents? By implementing an MVC architecture complete with authentication features, I devised a comprehensive solution for this challenge.
